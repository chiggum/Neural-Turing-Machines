Check out: https://github.com/fumin/ntm\r\n- Another NTM implementation in Theano by shawntawn. Check out: https://github.com/shawntan/neural-turing-machines\r\n\r\n## Future works\r\n- Making NTM to work on other tasks described in the paper.\r\n- Using NTM to make agents for playing games (Deep reinforcement learning).",
